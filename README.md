# turtle_mover
A game where two robot turtles battle for salad - my ROS2 practice.

Absolutely need to enter the following into terminal:
xhost local:root

this enables the forwarding of turtle sim gui to your machine

# docker-compose

$docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d --build

Wait for the images to build and the app should start
